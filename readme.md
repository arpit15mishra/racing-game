this is simple racing game made without using any graphic library. the graphic array of computer is used to develop the game using procedural
programming. one can easily convert this program to have oop design. random function are used to generate different level, but still the program 
is fully complete as i have presently limited it to only one level which can be easily extended once you read the code.
